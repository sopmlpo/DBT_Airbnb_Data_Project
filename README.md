#Airbnb Analytics Project with dbt
This project demonstrates the use of dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform raw Airbnb data into analytics-ready datasets. It highlights dbt's capabilities for modular, testable, and maintainable SQL transformations within a modern data stack.

##Features
Data Sources: Connects to a data warehouse to retrieve Airbnb data.
Data Transformation: Implements dbt models for cleaning and transforming data.
Testing: Includes tests for data quality and integrity, such as singular, generic, and source tests.
Documentation: Auto-generates documentation for the dbt project, including dependencies and model details.
Deployment: Demonstrates how to deploy transformations on a schedule and handle runtime errors.
Advanced Concepts: Utilizes macros, packages, and Jinja templates for code reusability and efficiency.
Tools and Technologies
dbt for transformation and modeling
SQL for defining business logic
Integration with Snowflake, BigQuery, or other data warehouses
Version control with Git
Key Learning Outcomes
Understand the dbt workflow: sources, models, tests, and documentation.
